Foreon Network's smart contract plays a pivotal role in enabling the creation and settlement of markets within the ecosystem. When a user initiates a market, a smart contract is deployed on the Cardano blockchain, governing the behavior of the market. This contract encompasses essential aspects such as market rules, settlement processes, and reward distribution. Within the framework of market rules, critical parameters such as event details, potential outcomes, and trading fees are defined. The settlement mechanism outlines how outcomes are resolved and rewards are allocated. Notably, binary markets rely on external events for outcome determination, and automated settlement processes execute, proportionally distributing rewards to participants.
Dispute resolution within Foreon Network involves a decentralized arbitration mechanism known as the Oracle. Arbitrators engage by staking cryptocurrency as collateral, ensuring impartial determinations. The consensus-driven outcome determined by the arbitrators dictates the settlement of the market and the subsequent distribution of rewards.
From a technical perspective, the process unfolds as follows: Users initiate markets by inputting event details, potential outcomes, and trading fees into the smart contract. Traders then interact with the smart contract to execute buying and selling of shares. The contract monitors share and fund movements, computes costs using the logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR), and updates relevant variables to maintain accuracy and transparency.
During the settlement phase, the smart contract employs predefined mechanisms to determine market outcomes and allocate rewards based on traders' positions. Should a dispute arise, the involvement of the Oracle is triggered. In this scenario, arbitrators, who form a decentralized network, participate by staking cryptocurrency tokens. The arbitrators' consensus-based decision ultimately determines the outcome of the dispute, safeguarding the integrity of the prediction market.
On the non-technical side of the platform's operation, user onboarding involves the submission of personal information and wallet addresses for account creation. Users then browse through available markets, selecting those that align with their interests. Traders strategize based on market parameters and event analysis to execute their trading decisions. Following market settlement, traders receive rewards, which can either be withdrawn or reinvested according to their preferences. Additionally, users can engage in the dispute resolution process by participating in the Oracle mechanism, staking cryptocurrency and providing supporting evidence to uphold their stance.
In a broader context, Foreon Network's smart contract architecture is meticulously designed to empower decentralized and trustless prediction market creation and settlement. It serves as the governing framework for every facet of market behavior, from the formulation of rules to the execution of settlement mechanisms and the equitable distribution of rewards.
Central to the mechanics of prediction markets are market scoring rules, which determine share prices for each potential outcome. Within Foreon Network, the logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR) is employed. This rule is characterized by the cost function C(q) = b * ln(sum(exp(q_i/b))), which contributes to the calculation of share prices (p_i = ∂C/∂q_i). Key parameters involved include q (share vector), q_i (shares for outcome i), and the liquidity parameter b.
In summary, Foreon Network's smart contract infrastructure provides the foundation for decentralized and transparent prediction market operations.

Foreon Network's innovative approach is set to redefine prediction markets with its decentralized protocol launching on the Cardano Blockchain. Through this approach, intermediaries are eliminated, ensuring transparent and trustworthy transactions. The implementation of the pari-mutuel betting system allows for fair distribution of pool funds among winning bets, while automated settlements streamline processes and reduce costs. Leveraging the speed and cost-efficiency of Cardano, the platform spurs innovation and industry growth, offering enhanced user experiences and adoption.
With its potential to revolutionize prediction markets, Foreon Network's initial prototype promises decentralized, transparent, and efficient trading. Through on-chain oracle-based market resolution and Cardano smart contracts, secure transactions are ensured, enabling the creation of markets based on future event outcomes and rewarding accurate predictions.
Foreon Network operates through a structured process: users acquire a Foreon NFT Chip, a prerequisite for market creation to ensure quality markets; to create a market, users stake DJED cryptocurrency based on their event outcome predictions; as trading commences, shares are exchanged, and share prices adapt according to perceived outcome probabilities; the ultimate payout depends on the actual event outcome; market creators earn a portion of fees for maintaining and establishing markets.
The choice to build on Cardano stems from its attributes as a third-generation blockchain. Its security, scalability, and sustainability are rooted in a scientific philosophy validated through peer-reviewed research and development. Cardano's Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, Ouroboros, ensures network security using its native cryptocurrency, ADA. The layered architecture segregates transactions and smart contract execution, bolstering flexibility and scalability. The treasury system allocates transaction fees to ongoing platform development, and its interoperability design facilitates interaction with other blockchains and traditional systems.
Foreon Network's anticipated launch on the Cardano Mainnet is slated for Q4 of 2023. Progress includes a functional proof of concept, a user-friendly interface, and an immersive user experience, all of which contribute to setting a new standard for user engagement. The team's current focus centers on the development phase, as they tirelessly work towards realizing the full potential of this innovative platform.
Delving into the private seed round and the impending Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO), this article offers insights into the intricacies of participation. The private round, designed exclusively for fewer than 100 addresses, extends a unique opportunity to early supporters. Upholding equitable distribution, a minimum investment of 10,000 ADA is established, providing investors with 12,500 FRN tokens in return. The private round reserves 10% of the total token allocation, underscoring its commitment to community members who demonstrate confidence in the project's inception.
An order book prediction market presents a distinct variation where buy and sell orders, detailing share price and quantity, mirror conventional exchange order books, facilitating wagers on future event outcomes. This structure allows participants to trade shares representing predictions, with share prices reflecting outcome probabilities determined by participants themselves. For instance, if you anticipate a specific event outcome, such as a political election result, you can buy shares representing that prediction. Successful predictions yield fixed returns per share, while incorrect ones render shares valueless, and open market trading causes prices to fluctuate based on supply and demand dynamics, harnessing collective participant wisdom for potentially accurate predictions, all requiring prudent risk understanding and responsible trading.
In prediction markets, the initiation of initial markets can be either platform-driven or user-initiated, depending on the platform's structure. Centralized markets often commence through platform operators, setting market parameters like questions and durations, enabling users to trade outcome shares. In decentralized prediction markets, any user can create markets by staking the platform's native tokens as a bond, ensuring good faith. Creators define market parameters, and trading begins. In both scenarios, initial share prices are influenced by outcome likelihood and trading incentives, further fluctuating based on user behavior. Event outcomes are determined through oracles or reporting systems, and upon resolution, holders of winning shares claim rewards, solidifying prediction market mechanics.
Foreon Network operates seamlessly through a Cardano wallet and web browser, ensuring your funds remain under your control in a non-custodial environment. To start, deposit ADA or DJED stablecoin into your Cardano wallet, which maintains stability by being pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Once funded, you can select a market, pick an outcome to speculate on, and acquire "outcome shares" using stablecoins, each priced between $0.01 and $1.00, reflecting aggregated outcome probabilities and varying based on expected resolutions. These shares can be sold before market resolution, and if your prediction proves accurate, they are redeemable at $1.00 per share. Should your prediction miss the mark, the shares hold no value. In cases of ambiguity, Validators in the Foreon Network ecosystem, holding $FRN tokens, determine outcomes, ensuring platform legitimacy and efficiency.
Foreon Network makes a strategic choice by adopting Aiken, a novel programming language and toolkit designed for Cardano's smart contracts. Aiken prioritizes robustness and developer experience, aiming to reduce fees and enhance scalability, aligning perfectly with Foreon Network's aspiration to handle high transaction volumes without imposing exorbitant costs, a concern commonly observed on the Ethereum network. Foreon Network further stands out in the realm of decentralized prediction markets by leveraging Cardano's lower fees, enabling share sales before market resolution, and providing heightened privacy in comparison to centralized counterparts.
Governance of Foreon Network lies in the hands of Foreon Utility token ($FRN) holders, with a total supply of 1,000,000 tokens. A portion of this supply is reserved for seed investors, granting them early access and potential Validator status. Detailed information about the seed round can be accessed through the Foreon Seed Deck link provided: https://docsend.com/view/xsevm63fdid6h435.

Emerging in 2023, Foreon Network reshapes the way public opinions on future events are aggregated, creating opportunities for staking and profit generation from accurate predictions.
The historical concept of prediction markets dates back to the 1500s when they were initially employed to forecast papal election results. Over time, these markets evolved into a recognized method for collecting perspectives on potential event outcomes, commonly referred to as idea futures, event derivatives, or information markets.
Taking this historical foundation into the modern digital era, Foreon Network emerges as a trailblazer by creating a non-custodial decentralized prediction platform. By harnessing this concept, users can stake tokens (ADA or $DJED stablecoin) on real-world occurrences like elections and sports events, with successful predictions yielding cryptocurrency rewards. This innovative digital betting platform prioritizes fund security and usability.
Getting started with Foreon Network is user-friendly, requiring only a Cardano wallet and web browser. After depositing ADA or DJED stablecoin into their Cardano wallet, users can seamlessly engage in markets, select outcomes, and purchase "outcome shares" using their stablecoins.
The mechanism behind outcome shares entails their value ranging from $0.01 to $1.00, with adjustments based on the market's anticipated resolution direction. Users maintain the flexibility to trade these shares at any point before the market concludes. Once the market closes and outcomes are determined, correctly predicted shares can be redeemed at $1.00 each.
In pursuit of scalability and reduced fees, the Foreon Network team strategically chose Aiken as the programming language for writing their smart contracts. Aiken, a novel programming language and toolkit tailored for smart contract development on the Cardano blockchain, offers a robust and streamlined developer experience.
Foreon Network brings a paradigm shift to the prediction market landscape online, delivering advantages such as lower fees, enhanced privacy, and the opportunity to liquidate shares before market resolution. These distinguishing attributes set it apart from its centralized counterparts.
The governance and tokenomics of Foreon Network are supported by the Foreon Utility token ($FRN), a Cardano Native asset boasting a total supply of 1,000,000 tokens. This token confers governance rights upon holders and the potential to serve as validators.

Foreon Stake Pool Information.
The Foreon Stake Pool, identified by the ticker FRN, is set to contribute significantly to the Foreon Network ecosystem. Operated by Foreon Technologies, this pool carries a 99% margin and offers an appealing opportunity for participants to earn rewards. The reward formula entails earning 1 $FRN for every 2000 ADA staked, though boosted rewards per epoch are excluded. As part of the initial distribution strategy, 2.5 million $FRN tokens, accounting for 25% of the total, will be earned during the Foreon ISPO (Initial Stake Pool Offering) and subsequently distributed using Tosidrop. The ISPO commences with Cardano epoch 433 on the 28th of August and will persist until all 25 million allocated $FRN tokens have been distributed. To engage in the first snapshot, individuals need to delegate their stake before epoch 433 starts on the 28th of August 2023, although participation beyond this initial snapshot remains possible.
The concept of an Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO) gains prominence within the Cardano community as a fundraising mechanism. It involves ADA delegators forgoing staking rewards to obtain a proportionate share of a Cardano native token, and in this context, the utility token $FRN within the Foreon network.
ISPO Mechanics.
The ISPO mechanism involves a structure that combines a 4 epoch cliff with a 40 epoch vesting schedule. Under this arrangement, the initial $FRN tokens become accessible to delegators 20 days after the conclusion of the ISPO. For instance, if a participant earns 8000 $FRN tokens and the ISPO concludes, they can claim 200 $FRN tokens 20 days after the ISPO ends. Subsequently, the claiming process continues, with participants receiving additional tokens in subsequent epochs. Delegation to the Foreon ISPO pool can be carried out using various Cardano wallets or platforms like pool.pm and cexplorer.io.
